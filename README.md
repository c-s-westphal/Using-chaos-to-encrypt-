# Using-chaos-to-encrypt-
Here using more common continuous and newly implemented discrete chaotic functions bits were encrypted. Attempts were then made at hacking said encrypted bits.
This is a personal project. I began by implementing multiple chaotic functions in python, these included Lorenz, tinkerbell and lorenz systems. I then 
implemented a discrete chaotic map. This map was based on the labels of permutations, the chaos arises due to operations on the permutations. Once all the 
chaotic maps had been implemented, they could be adjusted to encrypt a string of bits. There were then attempts made at hacking the encrypted bits. This low
power method of encryption is eventually expected to be used for small device security within the IoT. The discrete chaotic map is an exciting advancement and
seems to be the most rhobustly chaotic system known, this is shown to generalise to multiple dimensions.
